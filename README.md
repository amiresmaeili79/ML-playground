# ML-playground
I personalize some assignments of an online ML course and put them in here, with more flavor and colored stuff :D

## What is this repo about?
I have been taking some online courses about ML. I do the assignments and change some sections of them and add some new parts to them to make them more my type notebook.

## Topics
This courses will have multiple topics that I will add them eventually
1. Regression
2. ?

## What courses am I taking ?
Becuase of exposing answers I cannot tell their names but I won't stop you from finding it yourself. :D

## Code
Definitely these are not the **best practices** and 100% **clean codes** but I'm doing my best to suit good in notebooks and write clean and readable codes.
